1. Introduction

Networking knowledge is critical for cybersecurity because most attacks involve communication between systems.


2. OSI Model (7 Layers)

Physical – cabling, signals

Data Link – MAC addressing

Network – IP addressing, routing

Transport – TCP/UDP

Session – communication management

Presentation – encryption, encoding

Application – HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP


3. TCP/IP Model

Application

Transport

Internet

Network Access

Used in real-world networks.


4. Important Protocols
TCP

Reliable, connection-oriented (web, email, SSH)

UDP

Faster, connectionless (VoIP, streaming, DNS)

HTTP/HTTPS

Web browsing protocols.

DNS

Resolves domain names → IP addresses.

DHCP

Assigns IP addresses dynamically.

5. IP Addressing
IPv4 Format

Example: 192.168.1.10

Private IP Ranges

192.168.x.x

10.x.x.x

172.16–31.x.x

Subnetting

Dividing networks for efficient IP use.

6. NAT (Network Address Translation)

Converts private IPs to public IPs

Used in home routers

7. Packet Flow Basics

When you open a website:

DNS resolves domain

Browser sends TCP handshake

Server responds

Data is exchanged

Connection is closed

Understanding packet flow helps in traffic analysis and attacks.
