1. Introduction

Cryptography protects data through mathematical techniques. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

2. Types of Cryptography
a) Symmetric Encryption

Same key for encryption and decryption

Very fast

Example: AES

b) Asymmetric Encryption

Public key + Private key

Slower but more secure

Used in HTTPS, SSH

Example: RSA, ECC

3. Hashing

One-way function — cannot be reversed.

Used for:

Password storage

File integrity

Examples:

MD5

SHA-1, SHA-256

4. Digital Certificates & PKI

Used in HTTPS

Verifies website identity

Ensures encrypted communication

5. OpenSSL Practical Usage
Encrypt a File:
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt -out encrypted.bin
Decrypt a File:
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted.bin -out file.txt
6. Real-World Importance

Protects financial transactions

Secures communication

Prevents identity theft

Used in VPNs, SSH, SSL/TLS
