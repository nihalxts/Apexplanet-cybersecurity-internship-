1. Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, applications, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. Modern organizations rely heavily on digital systems, making cybersecurity a critical part of IT operations.

2. The CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity.

a) Confidentiality

Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
Techniques: encryption, authentication, access controls, passwords, 2FA.

b) Integrity

Ensuring information is accurate, unchanged, and trustworthy.
Techniques: hashing, checksums, digital signatures, version control.

c) Availability

Ensuring systems and data are accessible whenever needed.
Techniques: backups, redundancy, DDoS protection, fault-tolerant systems.

3. Common Cybersecurity Threats
Phishing

Fake emails/messages used to steal credentials.

Malware

Includes viruses, trojans, worms, spyware, ransomware.

Ransomware

Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.

DDoS Attacks

Overloads a server with massive traffic to disrupt availability.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)

Intercepting communication between two parties.

SQL Injection

Injecting malicious SQL commands to access database data.

Brute Force Attack

Trying multiple password combinations until one works.

4. Attack Vectors

Social Engineering: manipulating humans to reveal information

Network Exploits: exploiting insecure services

Physical Attacks: stealing devices, plugging malicious USB

Wireless Attacks: cracking WiFi, eavesdropping

Insider Threats: harmful actions by internal employees

5. Importance of Cybersecurity

Protects sensitive data

Prevents financial losses

Maintains trust & reputation

Ensures legal & regulatory compliance
